I architected the front end of a <a href="/work/Guru-Profile">responsive profile and search</a> to help you find and hire Freelancers on Guru.com.  
Or more recently, when I figured out what it would take to implement a <a href="/work/Guru-Manage">visual style guidelines</a> 
system with reusabe design patterns for our core product. 

Who can forget about when I helped <a href="/work/Schramm-Farms">small business</a> define their presence online.
